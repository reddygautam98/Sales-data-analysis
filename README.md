 # Background
- These queries deliver a dynamic analysis of sales performance and regional trends. The first reveals the top three products by sales amount for each size, spotlighting those with odd-numbered customers and providing rich geographic insights. The second highlights the leading salesperson in each region, showcasing top performers with an alphabetized regional overview. The third offers a comprehensive look at detailed sales data and pinpoints the top 5 sales regions, emphasizing key areas of success. Lastly, the fourth query uncovers high-value transactions from Q1, focusing on significant sales from January to March and presenting them in chronological order for a clear snapshot.
