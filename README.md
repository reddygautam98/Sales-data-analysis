 # introduction
 
 - In this sales data analytics project, we analyze sales data to uncover valuable insights. We calculate the cost per box sold by salespeople, retrieve detailed sales information, identify top-performing teams, and determine the best-selling products. Our exploration spans regions, product sizes, and sales amounts. Whether youâ€™re interested in individual performance or overall trends, this project provides actionable insights for data-driven decision-making.

 # Background

- This sales data analysis aims to understand performance across regions, products, salespeople, and customers. The dataset includes four tables: Sales (transactional data), Geo (geographical information), Product (product details), and People (salesperson data). Key objectives are evaluating sales performance by region, product revenue, salesperson efficiency, and sales trends over time. Insights will guide strategic decisions, optimize pricing, inform product development, and enhance performance management. By leveraging these findings, the organization can improve resource allocation, boost profitability, and achieve sustainable growth.

 # Tools I Used
For my deep dive  into the sales data analyst, i harnessed the power several key tools:

- SQL: The backbone of data analysis, allowing you to   query databases and uncover critical insights.

- PostgreSQL: A powerful database management system ideal for handling job posting data.

- Visual Studio Code: A go-to tool for managing databases and executing SQL queries.

- Git & GitHub: Essential for version control and sharing SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

 # The Analysis
 - Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspect of the data analyst sales here's how i approached each question :
 ### 1.Geographical Sales Insights
 - To identify  the total sales amount for each product by region.It joins the Sales, Geo, and Product tables, groups the results by region and product name, and calculates the sum of sales amounts , i filtered data analyst positions by avarage yearly in this query
 
 ``` sql
SELECT g.Region, p.Product_name, SUM(s.Amount) AS TotalSales
FROM Sales s
JOIN Geo g ON s.GeoID = g.GeoID
JOIN Product p ON s.PID = p.PID
GROUP BY g.Region, p.Product_name
ORDER BY g.Region, TotalSales DESC;
 ```
